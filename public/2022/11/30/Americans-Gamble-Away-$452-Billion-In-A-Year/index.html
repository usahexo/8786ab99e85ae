        <h1 id="Americans-Gamble-Away-452-Billion-In-A-Year"><a href="#Americans-Gamble-Away-452-Billion-In-A-Year" class="headerlink" title="Americans Gamble Away $452 Billion In A Year"></a>Americans Gamble Away $452 Billion In A Year</h1><p>Gambling, whether it is done in a casino, at the track, or on the internet, is a popular activity in the United States. In fact, Americans gamble away an estimated $452 billion annually.</p>
<p>While some people bet small sums of money and only do so occasionally, others engage in gambling more regularly and may bet larger sums of money. Regardless of how much someone gambles or how often they do it, though, there is always the risk that they will lose money.</p>
<p>In 2017, gambling losses totaled $117.5 billion. This was a 2.5% increase from the year before and means that Americans lost an average of $452 per person last year.</p>
<p>The lion’s share of these gambling losses came from casino games, which accounted for $52.5 billion in losses. This was followed by lottery tickets ($19.6 billion), racing (both horse and dog) ($11.8 billion), and sports betting ($5.9 billion).</p>
<p>While men tend to gamble more than women do, women account for a greater percentage of gambling losses (53% vs 47%). And while adults aged 18-34 account for the majority of overall gambling expenditures (57%), those over the age of 55 account for a greater percentage of losses (63%).</p>
<p>It’s not just Individuals who lose money when gambling either - businesses also incur costs. For example, the racing industry employs around 1 million people in the US and generates approximately $45 billion in economic output annually. However, this industry also suffers from job losses and business closures due to problem gambling. In fact, it’s been estimated that for every job created by casinos, two are lost as a result of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Clearly, gambling can be a major drain on both individual and business finances - not to mention the social costs associated with problem gambling. So before you next hit the casino or racetrack, remember that you’re not just risking your own money - you could be risking jobs and financial stability too</p>

<p>A report by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling has found that, in total, UK gamblers lose almost £14 billion each year. This amounts to around £462 per adult, or £2,052 per household.</p>
<p>The research also found that problem gambling costs the country a total of £5.6 billion annually – equivalent to around 1% of GDP. This is made up of lost taxes (£2.9 billion), costs to the NHS (£1.5 billion) and costs to social services (£1.2 billion).</p>
<p>The Campaign for Fairer Gambling is urging the government to do more to help problem gamblers, including increasing funding for treatment programmes and introducing tighter controls on gambling advertising.</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, spokesperson for the campaign Rob Miller said: “These figures are a stark reminder of the human cost of gambling addiction.problem gambling ruins lives and wastes billions of pounds each year. The government needs to take urgent action to address this issue”</p>
<p>Gambling is becoming an increasingly popular pastime in the UK, with around two-thirds of adults now betting regularly. This is partly due to the advent of online gambling, which makes it easier than ever to bet on sports, play casino games or bet on Eurovision outcomes from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>However, while online gambling can be fun and relatively harmless, it can also be addictive and lead to serious financial problems. In fact, according to recent figures from GamCare, problem gambling affects around 430,000 people in the UK – or roughly 1 in every 100 adults.</p>
<p>If you are worried that you or someone you know may have a gambling addiction, then there are a number of things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Talk to your GP – they will be able to refer you for specialist help if needed;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Visit Gambling Anonymous – this is a self-help group for people with gambling addictions;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact GamCare – GamCare is a national charity that provides free support and counselling for problem gamblers;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of helpful resources available online, including:</p>

<p>The University of Sydney study found that Australian adults lose an average of $1,000 a year on gambling, withproblem gamblers losing up to $10,000 a year.</p>
<p>The research, published in the journal Addictionon Wednesday, also found that around one third of Australian adults (5.8 million people) gamble at least once a month, with 2.5 million of them considered “problem gamblers”.</p>
<p>Most problem gamblers were men (1.7 million) and most were aged between 36 and 55 years old. problem gambling was more common in rural areas than in cities.</p>
<p>Lead author Associate Professor Charles Livingstone said the figures were shocking and called for urgent action to address the issue.</p>
<p>“These figures are a national tragedy and they underscore the urgent need for sensible regulation of gambling in Australia, together with effective harm-minimisation measures,” he said.</p>
<p>Livingstone said problem gambling could have a devastating impact on individuals as well as their families and friends.</p>
<p>“Problem gamblers are more likely to experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, to have relationship difficulties and to be unemployed or in financial difficulty than those who do not gamble excessively,” he said.</p>
<p>Australian Greens senator Richard Di Natale said the figures showed that gambling was out of control in Australia.</p>
<p>“This research confirms what we long suspected – that our love affair with poker machines is out of control and is causing immense harm to our community,” he said.</p>

This large expenditure can be attributed to the variety of gambling options available in Canada, including casinos, lotteries, and raffles.</p>
<p>The popularity of gambling has resulted in significant economic benefits for the country. In 2017, Canadian gambling businesses generated more than $17 billion in revenue, with over $9 billion of that being paid out as prizes. This money helps support jobs and local economies throughout the country.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, gambling can also have negative consequences for individuals and communities. Problem gambling can lead to financial hardship, family problems, and even crime. It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with gambling and to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones.</p>

<h1 id="Germans-Lose-More-Than-€11-Billion-Each-Year-To-Gambling"><a href="#Germans-Lose-More-Than-€11-Billion-Each-Year-To-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Germans Lose More Than €11 Billion Each Year To Gambling"></a>Germans Lose More Than €11 Billion Each Year To Gambling</h1><p>Germany is one of Europe’s biggest gambling markets. In 2016, turnover generated by the gambling industry was estimated to be over €11.5 billion. However, despite this high turnover, the German gambling market is far from lucrative for operators. In fact, it is estimated that Germans lose more than €11 billion each year to gambling.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the restrictive regulatory environment in Germany. Gambling is only legal in certain forms and under specific conditions, which has resulted in a highly fragmented market. There are currently around 1,000 licensed gambling operators in Germany, many of which are small and regional providers.</p>
<p>The result is that the big players in the German gambling market have a very low market share. The four biggest operators – Lotto Baden-Württemberg, WestLotto, Tipico, and Betfair – account for less than 10% of the market. This leaves the majority of the market up for grabs for new entrants.</p>
<h1 id="New-Entrants-Are-Poised-To-Win-Big-In-Germany"><a href="#New-Entrants-Are-Poised-To-Win-Big-In-Germany" class="headerlink" title="New Entrants Are Poised To Win Big In Germany"></a>New Entrants Are Poised To Win Big In Germany</h1><p>As a result of this highly fragmented market and restrictive regulatory environment, new entrants are poised to win big in Germany. There is a lot of room for growth, and as regulations loosen there will be even more opportunity for new players to enter the market and compete with the incumbents.</p>
<p>In particular, online gambling presents a huge opportunity for new players. Online gambling accounted for just 9% of total gambling revenue in 2016, but this figure is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as Germans become more comfortable with gambling online. This presents a huge opportunity for new players to exploit; they can enter the market at a fraction of the cost of traditional brick-and-mortar operators and quickly gain a dominant share of the online gambling market.</p>
<p>The restrictive regulatory environment in Germany may not last much longer though; there have been calls from within the government to liberalize the gambling market and make it more competitive. If these changes go through, it will be even easier for new entrants to penetrate the German gambling market and take advantage of all that it has to offer</p>
