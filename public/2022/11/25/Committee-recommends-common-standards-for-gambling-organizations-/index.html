        <h1 id="Committee-recommends-common-standards-for-gambling-organizations"><a href="#Committee-recommends-common-standards-for-gambling-organizations" class="headerlink" title="Committee recommends common standards for gambling organizations"></a>Committee recommends common standards for gambling organizations</h1><p>The Gaming Committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures has unanimously recommended a series of common standards for gambling-related organizations, including casinos, lotteries and race tracks. </p>
<p>The proposed standards would create a more consistent regulatory environment among the states and improve customer safety. They include: </p>
<p>• Minimum age requirements for gambling employees and customers<br>• Employee training requirements<br>• Background check procedures<br>• Investor disclosure requirements<br>• Rules governing marketing and advertising to protect people from predatory practices<br>The recommendations will now be sent to the states for further consideration.</p>
<h1 id="New-Hampshire-edges-closer-to-legalized-gambling-with-new-standards"><a href="#New-Hampshire-edges-closer-to-legalized-gambling-with-new-standards" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire edges closer to legalized gambling with new standards"></a>New Hampshire edges closer to legalized gambling with new standards</h1><p>In a big step for New Hampshire, the state has voted to legalize new forms of gambling. This includes internet gaming, fantasy sports and daily fantasy sports. The vote was close, but it looks like lawmakers have decided that the potential tax revenue is too good to pass up.</p>
<p>This is great news for casino operators in the state. They will now be able to offer their services online, and this should help them to attract more customers. It’s also good news for players, who will have more options when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>There are some concerns that the new regulations won’t be strict enough, but lawmakers believe that they can tighten things up as needed. For now, it looks like New Hampshire is moving ahead with legalized gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-industry-welcomes-new-standards-but-calls-for-more"><a href="#Gambling-industry-welcomes-new-standards-but-calls-for-more" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry welcomes new standards but calls for more"></a>Gambling industry welcomes new standards but calls for more</h1><p>Gambling industry representatives have cautiously welcomed new proposed standards from the UK Gambling Commission but say more needs to be done to protect players.</p>
<p>The standards, released yesterday, outline a number of requirements for gambling companies including robust age verification measures and social responsibility provisions.</p>
<p>Commenting on the proposals, Malcolm Bruce, CEO of the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), said: “We welcome the publication of the Gambling Commission’s updated guidance and we will work with our members to implement the new requirements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“While we believe that the new guidance goes some way towards improving standards in online gambling, we believe that more can and should be done to protect consumers and especially vulnerable ones. In particular, we would like to see additional guidance on problem gambling prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the Commission on this important issue.”</p>
<p>The RGA represents a number of leading online gambling operators including Bet365, Ladbrokes, Unibet and William Hill.</p>
<h1 id="Standards-provide-framework-for-safe-and-responsible-gambling"><a href="#Standards-provide-framework-for-safe-and-responsible-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Standards provide framework for safe and responsible gambling"></a>Standards provide framework for safe and responsible gambling</h1><p>A well-developed set of gambling standards can ensure that the gambling industry operates fairly and responsibly, minimizing the risks of social and financial harm. Standards provide a framework for safe and responsible gambling, while also allowing for innovation and new products in the industry.</p>
<p>The development of standards is an important step in the ongoing effort to protect consumers and minimize negative consequences associated with gambling. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) noted that “standards are needed not only at the consumer protection level, but at the regulatory and industry levels as well.”</p>
<p>The Consumer Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken a lead role in developing national standards for the gambling industry. In its recent report on online gambling, the CFPB identified five key areas where national standards are needed: consumer protection, data security and privacy, responsible marketing, problem gambling prevention and treatment, and financial regulation.</p>
<p>In many cases, state and provincial governments have also developed their own standards for gambling operators. For example, Nevada’s Gaming Control Board imposes strict licensing requirements on casino operators, while Alberta’s Gaming and Liquor Commission has regulations governing how much money can be gambled per day.</p>
<p>Standards provide a common framework that operators can use to ensure they are providing a fair and safe experience for consumers. They also help regulators to identify irresponsible or harmful behavior in the industry, and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>At a time when there is increasing demand for innovative new products in the gambling industry, it is important to have clear and consistent standards that ensure these products are safe and responsible. Standards provide certainty for both operators and consumers alike, creating a foundation for a healthy and sustainable gambling industry.</p>
<h1 id="International-gaming-experts-endorse-proposed-standards-for-gambling-organizations"><a href="#International-gaming-experts-endorse-proposed-standards-for-gambling-organizations" class="headerlink" title="International gaming experts endorse proposed standards for gambling organizations"></a>International gaming experts endorse proposed standards for gambling organizations</h1><p>A newly released report by a panel of international gaming experts has given a seal of approval to proposed new standards for gambling organizations. The panel, which was convened by the independent organization Gaming Standards Association (GSA), included representatives from the gaming industry’s major bodies – including casino operators, regulators and manufacturers.</p>
<p>The aim of the new GSA standards is to raise the bar in terms of safety, security and player protection across the board for all types of gambling, from casinos and gaming machines to online betting and lotteries. Among the key principles endorsed by the panel are requirements for rigorous integrity testing and improved financial transparency.</p>
<p>The new standards will be made available to all GSA members, who are urged to implement them as soon as possible. Commenting on the release of the report, GSA chairman Phil Gelber said: “This is an important day for our industry. These comprehensive standards represent a significant step forward in terms of protecting players and safeguarding our businesses. I would like to thank the panel for their hard work in producing this landmark document, and I urge all GSA members to adopt them without delay.”</p>
<p>The new GSA standards have been welcomed by gaming experts around the world. Speaking with reporters at a press conference in Las Vegas, one leading commentator described them as “a much-needed breath of fresh air for our industry”. He went on to say that they would set “a new global benchmark for player protection and operational excellence”.</p>
