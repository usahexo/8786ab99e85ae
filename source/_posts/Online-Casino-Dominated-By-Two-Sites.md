#  Online Casino Dominated By Two Sites

Online casino is a rapidly growing industry with more and more people gambling each year. The market is currently dominated by two sites, with the rest of the players struggling to make a dent.

The first site is Casino.com, which has been around for over 15 years. They offer a wide range of games and have a very user-friendly interface. The second site is 888 Casino, which was founded in 1997 and offers a similar experience to Casino.com.

These two sites have been able to build up large player bases thanks to their high quality games, generous bonuses, and excellent customer service. As a result, they have been able to attract the majority of online casino traffic.

The other players in the market are unable to compete with these two giants, resulting in them having much smaller market shares. Some of these players include PartyCasino, Bet365 Casino, and William Hill Casino. All of these casinos offer good games and bonuses but they can’t compare to the two leaders.

This situation is unlikely to change in the near future as the two leaders continue to grow and attract new players. The rest of the players will simply have to hope that they can carve out a small piece of the pie.

#  How Do Online Casino Sites Compare To The Rest?

There are a multitude of reasons as to why online casino sites are becoming progressively more popular than the rest. In this article, we will take a close look at some of the benefits that playing at an online casino can offer as opposed to its traditional counterparts.

To begin with, many people consider online casinos to be far safer and more secure than traditional ones. This is because the software used by most online casinos is regularly updated and monitored by independent auditors, whereas land-based casinos often lack such rigorous security measures. Furthermore, reputable online casinos are licensed and regulated by respected authorities, which means that they must adhere to certain standards in order to retain their licence.

Another major advantage of playing at an online casino is that you can generally claim more generous bonuses than you would at a traditional one. For example, many online casinos offer welcome bonuses that give new players a percentage of their initial deposit amount back as free cash. Online casinos also typically offer ongoing bonuses such as reload bonuses and loyalty programs, which give players rewards for continuing to play at the site.

In addition to bonuses, another big drawcard of playing at online casinos is the range of games on offer. Most sites offer hundreds, if not thousands, of different games for players to choose from, including Slots, Blackjack, Roulette and Poker. This wide variety means that there is something for everyone, regardless of their personal preferences or budget size.

Finally, one of the biggest advantages of playing at an online casino is that you can do so from anywhere in the world. All you need is an internet connection and a device (PC, laptop, smartphone or tablet) on which to play. This flexibility makes it easy for players to enjoy a few spins or hands while waiting for a bus or train, or even while sitting on the beach!
