#  Police shut down massive online gambling ring in Dickinson

​Police in Dickinson shut down a massive online gambling ring this week. Officers seized over $200,000 worth of computers and other equipment used in the operation.

​The scam had been running for several months, and authorities believe that thousands of people across the country were taken in by it. Victims lost thousands of dollars each in what amounted to a sophisticated Ponzi scheme.

​"This was a very elaborate and well-organized operation," said Dickinson Police Chief Robert Torgerson. "The people behind it are likely to face serious criminal charges."

​According to investigators, the gambling ring was run by a group of criminals from out-of-state. They targeted victims through online ads and lured them into depositing money into bogus accounts. Once they had enough money, the criminals would disappear, taking the victim's funds with them.

​"This is a reminder that you can't trust everything you see on the internet," said Torgerson. "Be very careful about where you deposit your money, and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is."

After executing a search warrant, police seized computers, phones, and other electronic devices used in the operation of the ring.

Authorities believe that the ring was responsible for generating over $1 million in illegal profits.

The 19 suspects will be charged with a variety of offenses, including racketeering, money laundering, and operating an illegal gambling business.

"This type of activity can be very dangerous," said Sergeant John Hanks of the Dickinson Police Department. "It can lead to addiction and debt, and in some cases can even lead to violence."

#  Authorities warning of the dangers of young people gambling online in Dickinson

There has been a recent uptick in the number of young people gambling online in Dickinson, and authorities are warning parents and caregivers of the dangers associated with it.

Online gambling can be very addictive, and can quickly lead to financial ruin for young people who are not prepared for it. Gambling can also lead to social isolation, depression, and other mental health issues.

#  Police urge parents to be vigilant about their children's activities online, especially gaming

With technology becoming more and more commonplace in society, especially among children and teenagers, police are urging parents to be more vigilant about their children's online activities. This is especially true when it comes to gaming, as there are a number of games that can be potentially harmful or dangerous.

One popular game that has come under fire in recent years is Fortnite. The game is a battle royale style game where players fight to the death, and it has been linked to a number of deaths and suicides. While it is not clear whether the game was directly responsible for any of these deaths, police are urging parents to be aware of the risks associated with the game and other similar games.

Other games that have been linked to violence or harm include Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Pokemon Go. These games often involve violence or gore, which can be potentially harmful for children. They can also lead to children being exposed to inappropriate content or images.

Parents should also be aware of the apps their children are using. There are a number of apps that are aimed at children but can be dangerous or harmful. One such app is Kik, which allows users to communicate anonymously. This can lead tochildren being exposed to inappropriate content or being contacted by strangers.

Parents should also be aware of the dangers of social media. Children can often be subject to cyberbullying on social media platforms, and this can have devastating consequences. Children should always be supervised when using social media, and parents should set appropriate privacy settings for their accounts.

It is important for parents to educate themselves about the dangers their children face online. By being aware of the risks and taking steps to protect their children, parents can help keep them safe online.
