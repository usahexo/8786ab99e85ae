#  I Lost $200 In Casino, But Got $100 In Free Play

I’ve been gambling a little bit lately.

Not in the casino, mind you. But at the racetrack. There’s something about the smell of the track, the sound of the horses pounding down the homestretch and, yes, even the occasional losing ticket that just makes me feel alive.

And, while I’ve never been one to take too many risks when it comes to gambling – I usually stick to betting Win, Place or Show – there is something about trying to pick a longshot that just seems irresistible.

Call it foolhardy, but I think there’s an art to picking a longshot. I’m not talking about throwing your money away on a horse that has no chance of winning. But finding that horse that is 12-1 or even 30-1 and betting just a small amount on them can be fun – and profitable – if you hit.

A few weeks ago, I was at my local track and put down $10 on a horse that was listed at 30-1. To my delight, she came in first and paid out more than $300 on my ticket.

While I didn’t make a killing, that win did wonders for my mood – and bankroll.

But as they say, there’s no such thing as a sure thing in gambling…which brings me to my next story.

Just last weekend, I decided to go over to the casino and give it a try. After all, I had won at the track recently so why not just keep the hot streak going? Bad idea. Very bad idea.

In less than two hours of playing blackjack and roulette, I had lost $200. Ouch! That really hurt…especially since I had only budgeted myself $100 for entertainment purposes.Thankfully though, the casino gave me back $100 in free play for my troubles which at least enabled me to walk away from the table with some sense of relief…and not too much money lost.

Overall though, I would have to say that my experience at the casino was a negative one. The games were tilted heavily in favor of the house and I just couldn’t seem to catch any breaks. In contrast, my experiences at the track have been much more positive with plenty of small wins padding out my overall profits..


It would be naïve of me to suggest that anyone stop gambling altogether if they happen to lose money while doing so (especially if it’s just for entertainment purposes). All I am suggesting is that if you do decide to gamble – whether it’s at the casino or racetrack – do so responsibly by setting limits for yourself beforehand and sticking to them!

#  I Lost $200 In Casino, But Got $200 In Free Play

I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but earlier this week I lost $200 in a casino. However, the casino gave me $200 in free play, so I came out even.

I was playing blackjack, and I was doing pretty well. I had about $350 in chips in front of me, when I went on a losing streak. In just a few minutes, I lost all of my money.

However, the casino gave me $200 in free play. So even though I lost $200 overall, I actually made $200.

This seems like a pretty good deal to me. The casino is basically giving you free money to gamble with. Of course, there's no guarantee that you'll win anything with the free play, but it's still worth checking out.

I'm not sure if this is a common practice at casinos, but it's something to look out for if you're planning on gambling. It's always nice to come out ahead, even if it's just by a little bit.

#  I Lost $200 In Casino, And I Didn't Even Care

I was at the casino for the first time in my life, and I was determined to make some money. I started out by playing roulette, and after a while I was up by $200. I thought that I had finally hit the jackpot, but then I started to lose it all. In the end, I lost $200, but I really didn't care.

I don't think that I've ever been so relaxed in my life. It was actually quite pleasant to just sit back and watch the wheel spin around. I didn't feel any anxiety or stress, even when I was losing money.

After spending a few hours at the casino, I decided to call it a night. Even though I lost $200, I still had a good time. In fact, I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

#  Casino Lost Me $200, But They Gave Me $100 In Free Play

I was down $200 after a few hours of casino play on a recent trip, but the casino comped me $100 in free play, so in the end I only lost $100. Casinos love to give away free play because it keeps people gambling, and it's a great marketing tool.

The way free play works is that the casino gives you a set amount of money to gamble with, and if you lose it all, then you can't continue playing. But if you win any money with your free play, then you can keep it. In my case, I managed to win back $50 of my original $200 loss, so in the end I actually made a small profit.

Free play is a great way to gamble without risking any of your own money, and it's a great way to build up your bankroll for future casino trips. Just be sure not to lose all your free play, or else you'll be out of luck!

#  Zola: I Lost $1,200 In A Casino, But Still Managed To Come Out Ahead

It was about 10pm on a Friday night and I was feeling lucky. I had just cashed in my paycheck and had $1,200 burning a hole in my pocket. I decided to head to the casino and try my luck.

I started off by playing blackjack. I was doing well, but then I got a bit greedy and started doubling down on every hand. This quickly blew through my $1,200 bankroll.

I decided to call it a night and head home. But as I was walking out, I saw a sign for the slots. I had never played slots before, but I figured what could it hurt?

I put in $100 and started playing. The first few minutes were frustrating - I wasn't getting any winning combinations. But then, finally, I hit a jackpot for $200!

After that, things started going my way. I won several smaller jackpots, which added up to another $400. By the time I left the casino, I had actually ended up winning $1,200!

Yes, I lost money in the short-term by gambling at the casino - but overall I still came out ahead. And that's why, even though it can be risky, gambling can still be fun sometimes!
