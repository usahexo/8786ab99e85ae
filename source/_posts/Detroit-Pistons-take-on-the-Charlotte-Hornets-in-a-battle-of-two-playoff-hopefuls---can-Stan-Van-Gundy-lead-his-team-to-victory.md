#  Detroit Pistons take on the Charlotte Hornets in a battle of two playoff hopefuls - can Stan Van Gundy lead his team to victory?

The Detroit Pistons (14-9) take on the Charlotte Hornets (10-13) in a matchup of two Eastern Conference playoff hopefuls. Stan Van Gundy’s Pistons have been one of the surprise teams in the NBA this season after missing out on the postseason last year, and they will be looking to continue their impressive start against Kemba Walker and the Hornets.

The Hornets have underperformed so far this season and find themselves in ninth place in the East, but they will be looking to improve on their record with a victory over Detroit. Walker has been a bright spot for Charlotte this year, averaging 22.7 points per game, and he will be looking to lead his team to a win over the Pistons.

Detroit has been led by Andre Drummond so far this year, who is averaging 17.0 points and 15.1 rebounds per game. Drummond is one of the most dominant players in the NBA, and he will be looking to control the paint against Charlotte. Tobias Harris has also been impressive for Detroit this year, averaging 16.8 points per game, and he will be looking to score against Charlotte’s porous defense.

The Pistons have been one of the best teams in the NBA at home this year, winning eight of their nine games at The Palace of Auburn Hills. They will be looking to extend their home winning streak against Charlotte on Wednesday night. The Hornets have had some success on the road this season, winning six of their eleven games away from home, but they will likely struggle against Detroit’s stout defense.

This should be a closely contested matchup between two evenly matched teams, but Detroit has the advantage at home and should come away with a victory.

#  Detroit Pistons look to continue their winning ways against the Philadelphia 76ers 

After a tough loss to the Golden State Warriors, the Detroit Pistons were able to bounce back and win their next two games against the Dallas Mavericks and the Orlando Magic. They will now look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers.

The 76ers have not had the best season so far, as they currently sit in last place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 10-37. However, they do have some talented players on their roster, including Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.

The Pistons are coming into this game with a lot of confidence, and they should be able to come away with a win. Blake Griffin has been playing extremely well lately, and Andre Drummond is always a threat on offense. The 76ers may be able to keep it close for a while, but in the end, the Pistons will come out victorious.

#  NBA betting fans gear up for an exciting matchup between the Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors

The Detroit Pistons (37-29) are set to take on the Toronto Raptors (51-19) in an exciting Eastern Conference matchup. The Pistons are coming into this game with high spirits, having won their last two games against the Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat. Blake Griffin has been playing exceptionally well lately, averaging 30 points per game in his last four matchups. The Raptors, on the other hand, have lost two of their last three games. Kawhi Leonard has been out due to a knee injury and is expected to return for this game.

This matchup is sure to be exciting, as both teams are fighting for a place in the playoffs. The Raptors currently hold the second seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Pistons are in sixth place. With Leonard returning to action, the Raptors are expected to come out on top in this matchup. However, Griffin and the Pistons are not going to make it easy for them, and this game is sure to be close.

# Betting odds:

The betting odds for this game are as follows:

Raptors -8.0
Pistons +8.0

The Raptors are favourites going into this matchup, as they should be. They hold a better record than the Pistons and have home court advantage. However, with Griffin playing so well lately and the Raptors losing two of their last three games, there is potential for an upset. The Pistons can definitely pull off the upset if they play well together and Leonard struggles from the field.

#  Will Andre Drummond and the Detroit Pistons dominate Dwight Howard and the Charlotte Hornets?

When Andre Drummond was drafted ninth overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons, there were high hopes for the young big man. Averaging 20 points and 20 rebounds per game during his last season at UConn, Drummond seemed destined for greatness in the NBA; however, his first few years in Detroit were inconsistent.

This season, Drummond seems to have turned a corner. He is averaging 17 points and 15 rebounds per game, and he is a major reason why the Pistons are in playoff contention. On March 10th, Drummond had a monster game against the Charlotte Hornets, scoring 33 points and grabbing 21 rebounds.

Dwight Howard has always been one of the best centers in the league, but he is currently having an inconsistent season with the Charlotte Hornets. With Al Jefferson out for the season, Howard has been forced to take on a larger role with the team; however, he has not been able to consistently produce at that level.

The matchup between Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard will be one of the most intriguing matchups of the first round of the playoffs. Both centers are incredibly talented and have the ability to dominate a game; however, only one can come out on top.

Who will win this matchup: Drummond or Howard?

#  Detroit Pistons face Milwaukee Bucks in a key game for playoff seeding

The Detroit Pistons face the Milwaukee Bucks in a key game for playoff seeding. This game will determine who gets the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs and home court advantage in the first round.

The Pistons come into this game having lost their last two games, both on the road. They are currently in 5th place in the East, but are only one game ahead of the Bucks. The Bucks have won six of their last ten games and are looking to improve their playoff position.

The Pistons have been led by Blake Griffin this season. Griffin is averaging 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game. He has been especially good in March, averaging 28.3 points per game. Andre Drummond has also been a big contributor for the Pistons, averaging 17.1 points and 15.0 rebounds per game.

The Bucks have been led by Giannis Antetokounmpo this season. Antetokounmpo is averaging 27.4 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.4 blocks per game. He has also been performing well in March, averaging 31.3 points per game. Khris Middleton has also been a major contributor for the Bucks, averaging 20.1 points per game.

This matchup should be a close one, with both teams fighting for the 4th seed in the East playoffs. The Pistons have had the edge over the Bucks this season, winning three of the four matchups between these two teams so far this year
